  "thought": "am not sure but the biggest hurdle that i have been facing with Claude code was managing context window. I think in latest releases , they have improved a lot. TO manage the  the  window better, i had to  create multiple  sub agents and delegate task to them whihc i  think no w    claude  code is doing by iteself . that has ma help ed in managing the context window better in the sessions ,.",

      "Context window management in Claude Code used to drive me insane. Spent hours building custom sub-agents just to delegate tasks and keep things from blowing up mid-session.",
      "The workaround worked, but it felt like duct tape on a leaky pipe. Every complex project meant spinning up 3-4 agents, manually routing tasks, tracking what each one knew. Exhausting.",
      "Then the recent updates dropped. And here's what surprised me—Claude Code now handles this delegation automatically. The thing I was manually engineering? Built-in.",
      "Still testing it on larger projects, but sessions feel noticeably smoother. Less context overflow, fewer \"I've lost track of what we were doing\" moments.",
      "Anyone else notice this shift? Or still running custom agent setups?"
