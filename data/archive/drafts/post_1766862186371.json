  "thought": "am not sure but the biggest hurdle that i have been facing with Claude code was managing context window. I think in latest releases , they have improved a lot. TO manage the  the  window better, i had to  create multiple  sub agents and delegate task to them whihc i  think no w    claude  code is doing by iteself . that has ma help ed in managing the context window better in the sessions ,.",

      "Context window management was my biggest pain point with Claude Code. I'd hit the limit mid-task and watch my AI forget everything we'd discussed. Frustrating as hell.",
      "My workaround? I built a whole system of sub-agents. Delegated chunks of work to separate contexts, then stitched results together manually. It worked, but felt like I was fighting the tool instead of using it.",
      "Then something shifted. Recent Claude Code updates seem to handle this automatically now. The tool creates its own sub-agents, manages context internally, delegates without me micromanaging every token.",
      "Sessions feel longer. More coherent. Less \"wait, what were we building again?\" moments. Still not sure if it's perfect, but the improvement is noticeable.",
      "Anyone else notice this? Or am I just imagining things because I stopped overloading single sessions?"
