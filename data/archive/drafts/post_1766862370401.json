  "thought": "am not sure but the biggest hurdle that i have been facing with Claude code was managing context window. I think in latest releases , they have improved a lot. TO manage the  the  window better, i had to  create multiple  sub agents and delegate task to them whihc i  think no w    claude  code is doing by iteself . that has ma help ed in managing the context window better in the sessions ,.",

      "Context window management in Claude Code used to drive me insane. Constantly hitting limits mid-session, losing track of what I'd already explained. My workaround? Building a whole system of sub-agents to delegate tasks and preserve context.",
      "Spent weeks perfecting this architecture. Had agents for file analysis, agents for code generation, agents for testing. Felt clever. Then something unexpected happened...",
      "Latest Claude Code releases started doing this automatically. The tool now manages context intelligently, delegating internally without me orchestrating everything. My elaborate system? Mostly obsolete.",
      "Still not sure if their implementation is perfect, but sessions feel dramatically smoother now. Less babysitting, more actual coding.",
      "Anyone else notice this shift? Or still building custom context management solutions?"
