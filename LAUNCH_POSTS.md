# Daily Voice - Launch Posts

## Product Hunt

**Title:**
Daily Voice - AI social posts that don't sound like AI

**Tagline:**
Think it. Post it. That's it. Stay consistent on Twitter without the 15-step workflow.

**Description:**

You learn things every day. You want to post them on Twitter.

But the workflow kills you:
- Open ChatGPT
- Prompt it about formatting
- Go back and forth
- Copy to Twitter
- Manually post
- Tomorrow: "Too busy"
- Result: Inconsistent → No growth

Daily Voice makes it one command:

```
daily-voice post "Just realized most startup advice is backwards"
```

It automatically:
- Formats for Twitter (hooks, threads, engagement patterns)
- Sounds like YOU (learns from your past posts)
- Posts it (or shows you a draft)

The problem isn't that you can't write. It's that the workflow takes 15 minutes and kills your consistency.

Daily Voice is the lowest-friction way to go from "I learned something" to "It's on Twitter."

Features:
- Humanization system (blocks AI-tell words, 90-100/100 human score)
- Fact-checking (validates claims before posting)
- Thread optimizer (smart splitting, proper hooks)
- Voice learning (adapts to your style)
- One-command publishing

Open source. MIT licensed. Free to use.

Built for anyone who wants to post consistently but hates the grind.

**First Comment (to post immediately after launch):**

Hey Product Hunt!

I built Daily Voice because I had a full-time job and wanted to post consistently on Twitter, but the workflow was killing me.

Open ChatGPT → Prompt about formatting → Go back and forth → Copy → Paste → Post

15 minutes every time. I'd skip days. Consistency died.

Daily Voice solves this: One command from thought to posted.

The breakthrough isn't better AI. It's removing all the friction between "I learned something" and "It's on Twitter."

Try it:
```
npm install
npm run post
```

It's open source (MIT). Self-host or run locally. Your data stays yours.

Would love your feedback. What friction kills YOUR consistency?

**Title:**
Show HN: Daily Voice - AI posts that don't sound like AI

**Post:**

I built Daily Voice to solve a problem I had: I wanted to post consistently on Twitter, but the workflow killed me.

The problem:
1. Open ChatGPT
2. Prompt it about Twitter formatting
3. Go back and forth on hooks/structure
4. Copy to Twitter
5. Manually post
6. Tomorrow: "I'm too busy"
7. Result: Inconsistent posting → No growth

Daily Voice makes it one command:

```
daily-voice post "Just realized most startup advice is backwards"
```

It automatically formats for Twitter (hooks, threads, what works), makes it sound like you (learns from your past posts), and posts it.

The core insight: Consistency requires low friction. This is the lowest friction possible.

Tech stack:
- Node.js CLI
- Claude API (best at following complex humanization rules)
- Twitter API v2
- Local JSON storage (no database)

Key features:
- Humanization system: Blocks 30+ AI-tell words, enforces contractions, natural flow. Human score: 90-100/100.
- Fact-checking: Validates claims before posting. Prevents "90% of startups fail in year 1" when it's actually 10%.
- Thread optimizer: Smart splitting, proper hooks, no wasteful short tweets.
- Voice learning: Analyzes your past posts, adapts over time.

Architecture is clean: Core engine is platform-agnostic. Publishers are swappable. Easy to add LinkedIn, etc.

It's open source (MIT). Self-host or run locally.

GitHub: https://github.com/san1302/daily-voice

Would love feedback, especially on:
- The humanization rules (what else screams "AI"?)
- Thread optimization logic
- Other platforms to support

Happy to answer questions about the implementation.

## Twitter Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**
I spent 6 months building Daily Voice.

It's an AI social post generator that doesn't sound like AI.

Open source. MIT licensed. Just launched.

Here's why it exists:

**Tweet 2:**
You learn things every day. You want to share them on Twitter.

But the workflow sucks:

Open ChatGPT → Prompt about formatting → Go back and forth → Copy → Paste → Post

Takes 15 minutes. You skip days. Consistency dies.

**Tweet 3:**
Daily Voice makes it one command:

```
daily-voice post "Just realized most startup advice is backwards"
```

That's it.

It formats for Twitter, sounds like you, and posts it.

Thought → Posted in 30 seconds.

**Tweet 4:**
The breakthrough isn't better AI writing.

It's removing all friction between "I learned something" and "It's on Twitter."

Consistency = growth.

Consistency requires low friction.

This is the lowest friction possible.

**Tweet 5:**
What makes it different:

Humanization system - Blocks 30+ AI-tell words. Enforces contractions, natural flow. Human score: 90-100/100.

You won't sound like ChatGPT.

**Tweet 6:**
Built-in fact-checking.

It validates claims before posting.

Example:
You: "90% of startups fail in year 1"
Daily Voice: "Actually it's 10%. Want me to correct it?"

Prevents embarrassing mistakes.

**Tweet 7:**
Voice learning.

It analyzes your past posts. The more you use it, the more it sounds like YOU.

Not generic AI. Your voice.

**Tweet 8:**
Thread optimizer.

Smart splitting. Proper hooks. Natural cliffhangers. No wasteful 50-character tweets.

It knows what works on Twitter.

**Tweet 9:**
It's open source (MIT).

Self-host or run locally. Your data stays yours.

No subscription. Just pay for API usage (~$0.01-0.05 per post).

**Tweet 10:**
Built for anyone who:
- Wants to post consistently
- Has a full-time job
- Learns things daily
- Hates the 15-step workflow

If that's you, try it:

GitHub: https://github.com/san1302/daily-voice

**Tweet 11:**
Roadmap:
- v1.0: Twitter (done)
- v1.5: LinkedIn, web UI
- v2.0: Scheduled posts, analytics

But v1.0 solves the core problem: Friction-free consistency.

**Tweet 12:**
If you've ever thought "I should post more but the workflow sucks"...

Daily Voice is for you.

Star the repo. Try it. Let me know what breaks.

## Email to Tech Influencers

**Subject:** Built something you might find useful

Hi [Name],

I built Daily Voice - an open source tool that makes it trivial to go from "I learned something" to "It's on Twitter."

The problem it solves: You want to post consistently, but ChatGPT → reformat → copy → paste takes 15 minutes and kills your momentum.

Daily Voice makes it one command. Automatically formats for Twitter, sounds like you, posts it.

Key differentiators:
- Humanization system (blocks AI-tell words, 90-100/100 human score)
- Built-in fact-checking (validates claims before posting)
- Voice learning (adapts to your style)

It's open source (MIT). Just launched today.

Would love your thoughts if you have time to check it out:
https://github.com/san1302/daily-voice

No pressure if you're busy. Just thought it might be useful for your workflow.

Best,
San

P.S. Built it for myself because I was inconsistent on Twitter despite having things to share daily. Now I'm not.
