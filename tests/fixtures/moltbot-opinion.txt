Been trying MoltBot for content automation. The promise is good - AI-powered social posting. But the execution feels half-baked. 

The posts it generates read like they were written by someone who learned English from LinkedIn inspirational quotes. Too polished, zero personality.

I wanted a tool that amplifies my voice, not replaces it with corporate speak. Maybe it works for brand accounts that don't care about authenticity. For personal stuff? Hard pass.
